        <p>“EKA’s initiatives focus on energy efficient peer-to-peer networking, availability of co-creation tools, and the way humans interact with them. Our initiatives are structured as open-source projects, with emphasis on modularity, documentation, permissive licensing, and other means that allow wide-adoption among community developers as well as global technology innovators. EKA regularly publishes research findings to enable stakeholders to think in a fundamentally different way about internet technology and how such technology affects human life and communities. EKA is currently active in several key trans-himalayan locations, with active community mesh networks in Ladakh, Spiti, and Himachal Pradesh, including the highest altitude solar-powered, community maintained network in the world.”</p>
