        <p>“EKA’s Skynet mesh-networks are solar-powered, decentralized, and highly resilient alternative internet infrastructure. Skynets are community-maintained and leverage widely available, low cost, energy efficient components. Running on EKA’s novel Skynet infrastructure, communities have access to free phone calls, weather and farming sensor data, video streaming, and other key community content features, as well as tools for publishing and co-creation. In addition intra-community and inter-community connectivity, EKA’s research and development focus on using radio, including FM through community radio stations, as a last-mile data delivery medium. We believe that by introducing meaningful technology interventions as an alternative for centralized internet; communities can be made more equal, stable, and sustainable.”</p>
